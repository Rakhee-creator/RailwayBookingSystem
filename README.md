# Railway Booking System 🚂✨

A simple Java console application that simulates railway ticket booking, cancellation, and seat availability.  
Built as part of my backend learning journey, practicing **loops, switch statements, and nested logic**.

- ❌ **Cancel Ticket**: Cancel a booked ticket and free up a seat.
- 📊 **Check Availability**: View remaining seats in each class.
- 🔁 **Loop Menu**: Continuous menu until exit, using `do...while` and `switch`.

## Tech Scrolls
- **Language**: Java  
- **Concepts Practiced**: Loops, Switch, Nested Switch, Edge Case Handling  
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Dynamic seat numbers
  - Passenger details
  - Integration with SQL for persistent storage
